# Huber HTR Dataset
This repository will feature the image and text lines from the Huber dataset used to train HTR models.

## Description
We have a dataset of letters by Eugen Huber (1849–1923), a Swiss lawyer and politician who wrote almost daily for over eight years to his deceased wife, containing details about his daily life and work. We aligned existing transcriptions and manually transcribed 3,757 pages from the letter collection using Transkribus. The Huber lines were pre-processed in the same manner as the ones from the Bullinger dataset. Our efforts have produced a ground truth of 88,154 lines comprising 679,533 words.

#TODO
upload the data: we will soon publish the data here.
